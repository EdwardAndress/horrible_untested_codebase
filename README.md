# Welcome to Abacus Inc.

##  Introduction

At Abacus Inc. we've been working on a new tool to help people perform arithmetic using less brainpower and fewer pebbles.  We call this tool the 'calculator'.

At the start of this great new adventure we hired someone to build the product but they did a pretty poor job.  The thing basically works but is totally untested and it's various components are not integrated!

Your first tasks here may take a while but we're a relaxed bunch and there is no particular deadline.

##  What we expect from you

We have had several planning session before you started and identified three pieces of work for you.  They are in priority order, so please complete the tasks in the order specified.

Your first job is to add tests and, to do that, you'll need to work out what needs to be tested.  We expect 100% test coverage by the time you're done.

Your second job is to integrate the three classes.  Please continue to use TDD here and write the tests first.  We want the `Calculator` to store answers in the `Memory` and output via the `Printer`, but the user should only have to interact with the `Calculator`.

Your third job is to add a new feature, using the Memory class, that allows users of the 'calculator' to do arithmetic using values stored in memory.

## To gain promotion at Abacus Inc.

Our long term vision for the 'calculator' to to improve the user experience by implementing a new syntax for non-commutative operations.  For example:

```
calculator.divide(4).by(2)
 => 2
calculator.subtract(1).from(2)
 => 1
```

If you complete this final task we will invite you to become the new CTO of Abacus Inc.
